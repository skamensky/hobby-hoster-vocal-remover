# Purpose

This repository is part of the [Hobby Hoster](https://github.com/skamensky/hobby-hoster) project.

This particular repo is specifically tailored for removing vocals from youtube videos. I created it for my nieces who love to sing karaoke.

This site is hosted at [instrumentals.kelev.dev](https://instrumentals.kelev.dev/).
